SARUWATARI HAZARD HANDLING

-> Data Hazard

   Being quite similar to DLX, SARUWATARI only suffers from read after
   write (RAW) hazards.
   
   Let's suppose to have the following instructions:

      instruction_0
      instruction_1
      instruction_2
      instruction_3

   Recall that SARUWATARI executes two instructions at the same time. So, to 
   detect data hazards, we will have to check for dependencies among instruction_0
   and instruction_2 and instruction_3 and among instruction_1 and instruction_2 and 
   instruction_3.

   There're three possible combinations:

      1. {instruction_0, instruction_1} is a {addi, subi, multi, lw}
         {instruction_2, instruction_3} is a I-type or a R-type instruction
